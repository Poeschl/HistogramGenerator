Histogram Generator
==================

If you need something quick to generate a histogram from a existing image, you have found a solution.

It has a simple ui and allows you to input a picture as png, jpeg, ...
And as output it shows you the histogram of the image, which can be exported as image file or raw data.

==================

Supporting input file formats:

- png
- jpeg
- gif
- all others (not tested)

Export histogram data as:

- .csv (comma-separated)
- .png
- (more is coming up)
